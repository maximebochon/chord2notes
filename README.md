# chord2notes

Java library to determine notes of a chord with exact accidentals according to tonal music theory.

This is strictly a personal project aimed at:
- strengthening my understanding of Western tonal music theory by putting it into practical algorithms
- practicing some Java skills (lambdas, templating engine, Java 15...)
- checking Unicode support in Java code

If you are looking for a mature and comprehensive Western tonal music theory library, please look away ;-)
